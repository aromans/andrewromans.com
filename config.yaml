  status: I am currently Reverse Engineering and Exploiting Binaries in the CS6265:InfoSecLab class at GaTech. This course covers reverse engineering, exploitation, binary analysis, and web topics while providing 11 to 12 challenges in a CTF format every week for the whole semester. 

  status_p2: On the side, I have finished 8/9 of the NSA Codebreaker Challenges and am slowly juggling Task 9 while working on the class challenges. Once this class is complete, I will be able to catch up on writing my baclog WriteUps and training for the PNPT Certification.
